Detecting users' receptivity is crucial to effectively delivering Just-in-time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). Indeed, several prior works have worked on using contextual information about a user to understand and model user receptivity, but often within a single study and intervention type. This paper explores if receptivity-modeling varies across different study populations and interventions. We analyzed data from over 1500 participants from three studies receiving different interventions and evaluated the feasibility of building reproducible methods to detect receptivity.
