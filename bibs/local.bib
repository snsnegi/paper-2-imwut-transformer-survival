Use this bibliography file only for odd little references that don't belong in Zotero.
It is especially useful for references to web pages (URLs that are not a published 'article').
Use the 'electronic', 'url', or 'www' entry style (all equivalent) instead of 'misc' or 'article';
these entry styles are supported by David's BibTeX styles that end in *DOI.bst.

For example, below is a ref to our GitHub repos.  The month/year refer to the date visited, not date published.
Note how I use an inner set of braces in the title to prevent BibTeX from converting it to Sentence Case; that is, it leaves capitalization as-is.
Note how I use an inner set of braces in the author name to force BibTeX to treat it as a phrase, not a name; this approach is useful for organizational names.

However, it is unclear if and how personality traits can be changed in desired directions. A 3-mo digital personality change intervention was deployed, and a large-scale randomized controlled trial (n = 1,523) was conducted to examine the effects of intended personality change in a nonclinical sample. The intervention group showed greater changes than the control group, and changes aligned with intended goals for change. Observers also perceived personality changes, but reported changes were less pronounced. Moreover, self- and observer-reported changes persisted until 3 mo after the end of the intervention. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that normal personality traits can be changed through intervention in nonclinical samples. Personality traits predict important life outcomes, such as success in love and work life, well-being, health, and longevity. Given these positive relations to important outcomes, economists, policy makers, and scientists have proposed intervening to change personality traits to promote positive life outcomes. However, nonclinical interventions to change personality traits are lacking so far in large-scale naturalistic populations. This study (n = 1,523) examined the effects of a 3-mo digital personality change intervention using a randomized controlled trial and the smartphone application PEACH (PErsonality coACH). Participants who received the intervention showed greater self-reported changes compared to participants in the waitlist control group who had to wait 1 mo before receiving the intervention. Self-reported changes aligned with intended goals for change and were significant for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.52) and for those desiring to decrease on a trait (d = −0.58). Observers such as friends, family members, or intimate partners also detected significant personality changes in the desired direction for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.35). Observer-reported changes for those desiring to decrease on a trait were not significant (d = −0.22). Moreover, self- and observer-reported changes persisted until 3 mo after the end of the intervention. This work provides the strongest evidence to date that normal personality traits can be changed through intervention in nonclinical samples.},

   abstract = {Background The just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an intervention design aiming to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual's changing internal and contextual state. The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual's state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment. Purpose Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap. Methods Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration. Conclusion As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions. Particular attention has to be given to better understanding the implications of providing timely and ecologically sound support for intervention adherence and retention.},

   abstract = {Wearable wireless sensors for health monitoring are enabling the design and delivery of just-in-time interventions (JITI). Critical to the success of JITI is to time its delivery so that the user is available to be engaged. We take a first step in modeling users' availability by analyzing 2,064 hours of physiological sensor data and 2,717 self-reports collected from 30 participants in a week-long field study. We use delay in responding to a prompt to objectively measure availability. We compute 99 features and identify 30 as most discriminating to train a machine learning model for predicting availability. We find that location, affect, activity type, stress, time, and day of the week, play significant roles in predicting availability. We find that users are least available at work and during driving, and most available when walking outside. Our model finally achieves an accuracy of 74.7% in 10-fold cross-validation and 77.9% with leave-one-subject-out.},

   abstract = {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a naïve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

In this paper we present a study of mobile user interruptibility with respect to notification content, its sender, and the context in which a notification is received. In a real-world study we collect around 70,000 instances of notifications from 35 users. We group notifications according to the applications that initiated them, and the social relationship between the sender and the receiver. Then, by considering both content and context information, such as the current activity of a user, we discuss the design of classifiers for learning the most opportune moment for the delivery of a notification carrying a specific type of information. Our results show that such classifiers lead to a more accurate prediction of users' interruptibility than an alternative approach based on user-defined rules of their own interruptibility.},

   abstract = {The potential for sensor-enabled mobile devices to proac-tively present information when and where users need it ranks among the greatest promises of ubiquitous computing. Unfortunately , mobile phones, PDAs, and other computing devices that compete for the user's attention can contribute to interruption irritability and feelings of information overload. Designers of mobile computing interfaces, therefore, require strategies for minimizing the perceived interruption burden of proactively delivered messages. In this work, a context-aware mobile computing device was developed that automatically detects postural and ambulatory activity transitions in real time using wireless accelerometers. This device was used to experimentally measure the receptivity to interruptions delivered at activity transitions relative to those delivered at random times. Messages delivered at activity transitions were found to be better received, thereby suggesting a viable strategy for context-aware message delivery in sensor-enabled mobile computing devices.},

In this paper we present an in-situ study of mobile interruptibility focusing on the effect of cognitive and physical factors on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification. Through a mixed method of automated smartphone logging and experience sampling we collected 10372 in-thewild notifications and 474 questionnaire responses on notification perception from 20 users. We found that the response time and the perceived disruption from a notification can be influenced by its presentation, alert type, sender-recipient relationship as well as the type, completion level and complexity of the task in which the user is engaged. We found that even a notification that contains important or useful content can cause disruption. Finally, we observe the substantial role of the psychological traits of the individuals on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification.},

It is therefore important to minimize a user's mental effort due to notifications, especially in situations where users are mobile and using multiple wearable and mobile devices. To this end, we propose Attelia II, a novel middleware that identifies breakpoints in users' lives while using those devices, and delivers notifications at these moments. Attelia II works in real-Time and uses only the mobile and wearable devices that users naturally use and wear, without any modifications to applications, and without any dedicated psycho-physiological sensors. Our in-The-wild evaluation in users' multi-device environment (smart phones and smart watches) with 41 participants for 1 month validated the effectiveness of Attelia. Our new physical activity-based breakpoint detection, in addition to the UI Event-based breakpoint detection, resulted in a 71.8% greater reduction of users' perception of workload, compared with our previous system that used UI events only. Adding this functionality to a smart watch reduced workload perception by 19.4% compared to random timing of notification deliveries. Our multi-device breakpoint detection across smart phones and watches resulted in about 3 times greater reduction in workload perception than our previous system.},

Our work here is based on the observation that people usually exhibit different levels of busyness at different contexts. This means that classifying users' interruptibility as a binary status, interruptible or not interruptible, is not sufficient to accurately measure their availability towards smartphone interruptions. In this paper, we propose, implement and evaluate a two-stage hierarchical model to predict people's interruptibility intensity. Our work is the first to introduce personality traits into inter-ruptibility prediction model, and we found that personality data improves the prediction significantly. Our model boot-straps the prediction with similar people's data, and provides a good initial prediction for users whose individual models have not been trained on their own data yet. Overall prediction accuracy of our model can reach 66.1%.},

   abstract = {Background: The Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally) app is a smartphone application that combines financial incentives with chatbot-guided interventions to encourage users to reach personalized daily step goals. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of incentives, weekly planning, and daily self-monitoring prompts that were used as intervention components as part of the Ally app. Methods: We conducted an 8 week optimization trial with n = 274 insurees of a health insurance company in Switzerland. At baseline, participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs. charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of the study, participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not receiving a self-monitoring prompt. Primary outcome was the achievement of personalized daily step goals. Results: Study participants were more active and healthier than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives increased step-goal achievement by 8.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 14.1] and, only in the no-incentive control group, action planning increased step-goal achievement by 5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2, 10.4]. Charity incentives, self-monitoring prompts, and coping planning did not affect physical activity. Engagement with planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts was low and 30% of participants stopped using the app over the course of the study. Conclusions: Daily cash incentives increased physical activity in the short term. Planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts require revision before they can be included in future versions of the app. Selection effects and engagement can be important challenges for physical-activity apps.},

   abstract = {Background: Smartphones enable the implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that tailor the delivery of health interventions over time to user- and time-varying context characteristics. Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user’s context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to quantify main effects, interactions, and moderators of 3 intervention components of a smartphone-based intervention for physical activity. The secondary objective is the exploration of participants’ states of receptivity, that is, situations in which participants are more likely to react to intervention notifications through collection of smartphone sensor data. Methods: In 2017, we developed the Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally), a chatbot-based mobile health intervention for increasing physical activity that utilizes incentives, planning, and self-monitoring prompts to help participants meet personalized step goals. We used a microrandomized trial design to meet the study objectives. Insurees of a large Swiss insurance company were invited to use the Ally app over a 12-day baseline and a 6-week intervention period. Upon enrollment, participants were randomly allocated to either a financial incentive, a charity incentive, or a no incentive condition. Over the course of the intervention period, participants were repeatedly randomized on a daily basis to either receive prompts that support self-monitoring or not and on a weekly basis to receive 1 of 2 planning interventions or no planning. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire at baseline and postintervention follow-up. Results: Data collection was completed in January 2018. In total, 274 insurees (mean age 41.73 years; 57.7% [158/274] female) enrolled in the study and installed the Ally app on their smartphones. Main reasons for declining participation were having an incompatible smartphone (37/191, 19.4%) and collection of sensor data (35/191, 18.3%). Step data are available for 227 (82.8%, 227/274) participants, and smartphone sensor data are available for 247 (90.1%, 247/274) participants. Conclusions: This study describes the evidence-based development of a JITAI for increasing physical activity. If components prove to be efficacious, they will be included in a revised version of the app that offers scalable promotion of physical activity at low cost.},

   abstract = {Background: The number of smartphone apps that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of depression is increasing. A promising approach to increase the effectiveness of the apps while reducing the individual’s burden is the use of just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) mechanisms. JITAIs are designed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention and reduce the burden on the person using the intervention by providing the right type of support at the right time. The right type of support and the right time are determined by measuring the state of vulnerability and the state of receptivity, respectively. Objective: The aim of this study is to systematically assess the use of JITAI mechanisms in popular apps for individuals with depression. Methods: We systematically searched for apps addressing depression in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as in curated lists from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the United Kingdom National Health Service, and the American Psychological Association in August 2020. The relevant apps were ranked according to the number of reviews (Apple App Store) or downloads (Google Play Store). For each app, 2 authors separately reviewed all publications concerning the app found within scientific databases (PubMed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM Portal, and Science Direct), publications cited on the app’s website, information on the app’s website, and the app itself. All types of measurements (eg, open questions, closed questions, and device analytics) found in the apps were recorded and reviewed. Results: None of the 28 reviewed apps used JITAI mechanisms to tailor content to situations, states, or individuals. Of the 28 apps, 3 (11%) did not use any measurements, 20 (71%) exclusively used self-reports that were insufficient to leverage the full potential of the JITAIs, and the 5 (18%) apps using self-reports and passive measurements used them as progress or task indicators only. Although 34% (23/68) of the reviewed publications investigated the effectiveness of the apps and 21% (14/68) investigated their efficacy, no publication mentioned or evaluated JITAI mechanisms. Conclusions: Promising JITAI mechanisms have not yet been translated into mainstream depression apps. Although the wide range of passive measurements available from smartphones were rarely used, self-reported outcomes were used by 71% (20/28) of the apps. However, in both cases, the measured outcomes were not used to tailor content and timing along a state of vulnerability or receptivity. Owing to this lack of tailoring to individual, state, or situation, we argue that the apps cannot be considered JITAIs. The lack of publications investigating whether JITAI mechanisms lead to an increase in the effectiveness or efficacy of the apps highlights the need for further research, especially in real-world apps.},

Using a multi-stage model, we systematically analyzed the responses to deepen our understanding of receptivity using a mixed methodology.

   abstract = {Background: Advancements in technology offer new opportunities for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Venture capital companies have been investing in digital diabetes companies that offer digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). However, little is known about the scientific evidence underpinning such interventions or the degree to which these interventions leverage novel technology-driven automated developments such as conversational agents (CAs) or just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) approaches. Objective: Our objectives were to identify the top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes management and prevention, review the level of scientific evidence underpinning the DBCIs, identify which DBCIs are recognized as evidence-based programs by quality assurance authorities, and examine the degree to which these DBCIs include novel automated approaches such as CAs and JITAI mechanisms. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using 2 venture capital databases (Crunchbase Pro and Pitchbook) to identify the top-funded companies offering interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention and management. Scientific publications relating to the identified DBCIs were identified via PubMed, Google Scholar, and the DBCIs' websites, and data regarding intervention effectiveness were extracted. The Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was used to identify the recognition status. The DBCIs' publications, websites, and mobile apps were reviewed with regard to the intervention characteristics. Results: The 16 top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes received a total funding of US 2.4 billion as of June 15, 2021. Only 4 out of the 50 identified publications associated with these DBCIs were fully powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further, 1 of those 4 RCTs showed a significant difference in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) outcomes between the intervention and control groups. However, all the studies reported HbA1c improvements ranging from 0.2 to 1.9 over the course of 12 months. In addition, 6 interventions were fully recognized by the DPRP to deliver evidence-based programs, and 2 interventions had a pending recognition status. Health professionals were included in the majority of DBCIs (13/16, 81,), whereas only 10 (1/10) of accessible apps involved a CA as part of the intervention delivery. Self-reports represented most of the data sources (74/119, 62) that could be used to tailor JITAIs. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the level of funding received by companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes prevention and management does not coincide with the level of evidence on the intervention effectiveness. There is considerable variation in the level of evidence underpinning the different DBCIs and an overall need for more rigorous effectiveness trials and transparent reporting by quality assurance authorities. Currently, very few DBCIs use automated approaches such as CAs and JITAIs, limiting the scalability and reach of these solutions.},

@article{Fogg2009,
   abstract = {This paper presents a new model for understanding human behavior. In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2) have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to perform the behavior. These three factors must occur at the same moment, else the behavior will not happen. The FBM is useful in analysis and design of persuasive technologies. The FBM also helps teams work together efficiently because this model gives people a shared way of thinking about behavior change. The Need to Understand Behavior Change The tools for creating persuasive products are getting easier to use, with innovations in online video, social networks, and metrics, among others. As a result, more individuals and organizations can design experiences they hope will influence people's behaviors via technology channels. However, many attempts at persuasive design fail because people don't understand what factors lead to behavior change. This paper shares a new way to understand the drivers of human behavior, a model referred to in this document as the Fogg Behavior Model, or "FBM" for brevity. This psychological model identifies and defines three factors that control whether a behavior is performed. (Note: In this paper and in this model, "persuasion" refers to attempts to influence people's behaviors, not attitudes.) The FBM can give insight to behavior-change professionals in many domains, from health to education to sales. This framework has special relevance to those of us who study and design persuasive technology. As I see it, persuasive technology is fundamentally about learning to automate behavior change. To effectively encode experiences that change behaviors, we need a rich yet practical understanding of human psychology, specifically insights into the factors that drive human behavior. Without this understanding, designers of persuasive experiences are mostly guessing at a solution (or imitating techniques that work without understanding why those techniques work). The FBM provides designers and researchers with a systematic way to think about the factors underlying behavior change. Because the FBM is new, insights continue to emerge. This paper is an early way to share these ideas and seek feedback. Certainly, a static document like this paper is not well suited for conveying emerging content and related work. I encourage readers to see www.BehaviorModel.org for the most current explanation of the FBM, as well as citations to and discussions of related theories and models. That website also solicits feedback on the FBM.},

   abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps show vast potential in supporting patients and health care systems with the increasing prevalence and economic costs of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. However, despite the availability of evidence-based mHealth apps, a substantial proportion of users do not adhere to them as intended and may consequently not receive treatment. Therefore, understanding the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of adherence is a fundamental concern in preventing intervention dropouts and increasing the effectiveness of digital health interventions.
Objective: This review aimed to help stakeholders develop more effective digital health interventions by identifying factors influencing the continued use of mHealth apps targeting NCDs. We further derived quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate the qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search (January 2007 to December 2020) was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library. Data on intended use, actual use, and factors influencing adherence were extracted. Intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence are presented separately for the health domains of NCD self-management, mental health, substance use, nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, mindfulness, and other NCDs. Quantified adherence measures, calculated as the ratio between the estimated intended use and actual use, were derived for each study and compared with the qualitative findings.
Results: The literature search yielded 2862 potentially relevant articles, of which 99 (3.46) were included as part of the inclusion criteria. A total of 4 intervention-related factors indicated positive effects on adherence across all health domains: personalization or tailoring of the content of mHealth apps to the individual needs of the user, reminders in the form of individualized push notifications, user-friendly and technically stable app design, and personal support complementary to the digital intervention. Social and gamification features were also identified as drivers of app adherence across several health domains. A wide variety of patient-related factors such as user characteristics or recruitment channels further affects adherence. The derived adherence scores of the included mHealth apps averaged 56.0 (SD 24.4).
Conclusions: This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to quantitatively compare adherence relative to the intended use of various health domains. As underlying studies mostly have a pilot character with short study durations, research on factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps is still limited. To facilitate future research on mHealth app adherence, researchers should clearly outline and justify the app’s intended use; report objective data on actual use relative to the intended use; and, ideally, provide long-term use and retention data.},

   abstract = {Objective: To assess the effects of pictures on health communications. Method: Peer reviewed studies in health education, psychology, education, and marketing journals were reviewed. There was no limit placed on the time periods searched. Results: Pictures closely linked to written or spoken text can, when compared to text alone, markedly increase attention to and recall of health education information. Pictures can also improve comprehension when they show relationships among ideas or when they show spatial relationships. Pictures can change adherence to health instructions, but emotional response to pictures affects whether they increase or decrease target behaviors. All patients can benefit, but patients with low literacy skills are especially likely to benefit. Patients with very low literacy skills can be helped by spoken directions plus pictures to take home as reminders or by pictures plus very simply worded captions. Practice implications: Educators should: (1) ask "how can I use pictures to support key points?", (2) minimize distracting details in pictures, (3) use simple language in conjunction with pictures, (4) closely link pictures to text and/or captions, (5) include people from the intended audience in designing pictures, (6) have health professionals plan the pictures, not artists, and (7) evaluate pictures' effects by comparing response to materials with and without pictures. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   abstract = {Objective: Assess the effect of pictorial health information on patients’ and consumers’ health behaviors and outcomes, evaluate these effects in lower health literacy populations, and examine the attributes of the interventions. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effect of pictorial health information on patient and consumer health behaviors and outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs that assessed knowledge/understanding, recall, or adherence, and a subgroup analysis of those outcomes on lower health literacy populations. We narratively reviewed characteristics of pictorial health interventions that significantly improved outcomes for lower health literacy populations. Results: From 4160 records, we included 54 RCTs (42 in meta-analysis). Pictorial health information moderately improved knowledge/understanding and recall overall, but largely increased knowledge/understanding for lower health literacy populations (n = 13), all with substantial heterogeneity. Icons with few words may be most helpful in conveying health information. Conclusion: Our results support including pictures in health communication to improve patient knowledge. Our results should be interpreted with caution considering the significant heterogeneity of the meta-analysis outcomes. Practice implications: Future research should assess which types and characteristics of pictures that best convey health information and are most useful and the implementation and sustainability in healthcare contexts.

   abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. © 1991.},

   abstract = {Every night, a large number of idle smartphones are plugged into a power source for recharging the battery. Given the increasing computing capabilities of smartphones, these idle phones constitute a sizeable computing infrastructure. Therefore, for an enterprise which supplies its employees with smartphones, we argue that a computing infrastructure that leverages idle smartphones being charged overnight is an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to running tasks on traditional server infrastructure. While parallel execution and scheduling models exist for servers (e.g., MapReduce), smartphones present a unique set of technical challenges due to the heterogeneity in CPU clock speed, variability in network bandwidth, and lower availability compared to servers. In this paper, we address many of these challenges to develop CWC-a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones. Specifically, our contributions are: (i) we profile the charging behaviors of real phone owners to show the viability of our approach, (ii) we enable programmers to execute parallelizable tasks on smart-phones with little effort, (iii) we develop a simple task migration model to resume interrupted task executions, and (iv) we implement and evaluate a prototype of CWC (with 18 Android smart-phones) that employs an underlying novel scheduling algorithm to minimize the makespan of a set of tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the performance of our approach makes our vision viable. Further, we explicitly evaluate the performance of CWC's scheduling component to demonstrate its efficacy compared to other possible approaches. © 2012 ACM.},

The system uses statistical models to realize defer-to-breakpoint policies for managing notifications. The first study tested how well the models detect three types of breakpoints within novel task sequences. Results show that the models detect breakpoints reasonably well, but struggle to differentiate their type. Our second study explored effects of managing notifications with our system on users and their tasks. Results showed that scheduling notifications at breakpoints reduces frustration and reaction time relative to delivering them immediately. We also found that the relevance of notification content determines the type of breakpoint at which it should be delivered. The core concept of scheduling notifications at breakpoints fits well with how users prefer notifications to be managed. This indicates that users would likely adopt the use of notification management systems in practice.},

Instant Messaging, or IM, has been growing in popularity for personal and work-related communication. The low cost of sending a message, combined with the limited awareness provided by current IM systems result in messages often arriving at inconvenient or disruptive times. In a step towards solving this problem, we created statistical models that successfully predict responsiveness to incoming instant messages-simply put: whether the receiver is likely to respond to a message within a certain time period. These models were constructed using a large corpus of real IM interaction collected from 16 participants, including over 90,000 messages. The models we present can predict, with accuracy as high as 90.1%, whether a message sent to begin a new session of communication would get a response within 30 seconds, 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes. This type of prediction can be used, for example, to drive online-status indicators, or in services aimed at finding potential communicators.},

   abstract = {Background: This protocol describes a study that will test the effectiveness of a 10-week non-clinical psychological coaching intervention for intentional personality change using a smartphone application. The goal of the intervention is to coach individuals who are willing and motivated to change some aspects of their personality, i.e., the Big Five personality traits. The intervention is based on empirically derived general change mechanisms from psychotherapy process-outcome research. It uses the smartphone application PEACH (PErsonality coACH) to allow for a scalable assessment and tailored interventions in the everyday life of participants. A conversational agent will be used as a digital coach to support participants to achieve their personality change goals. The goal of the study is to examine the effectiveness of the intervention at post-test assessment and three-month follow-up. Methods/Design: A 2x2 factorial between-subject randomized, wait-list controlled trial with intensive longitudinal methods will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants will be randomized to one of four conditions. One experimental condition includes a conversational agent with high self-awareness to deliver the coaching program. The other experimental condition includes a conversational agent with low self-awareness. Two wait-list conditions refer to the same two experimental conditions, albeit with four weeks without intervention at the beginning of the study. The 10-week intervention includes different types of micro-interventions: (a) individualized implementation intentions, (b) psychoeducation, (c) behavioral activation tasks, (d) self-reflection, (e) resource activation, and (f) individualized progress feedback. Study participants will be at least 900 German-speaking adults (18 years and older) who install the PEACH application on their smartphones, give their informed consent, pass the screening assessment, take part in the pre-test assessment and are motivated to change or modify some aspects of their personality. Discussion: This is the first study testing the effectiveness of a smartphone- and conversational agent-based coaching intervention for intended personality change. Given that this novel intervention approach proves effective, it could be implemented in various non-clinical settings and could reach large numbers of people due to its low-threshold character and technical scalability.},

Previous studies have relied on self-reporting to evaluate the total volume of sedentary time as a prognostic risk factor for mortality and have not examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in short or long bouts) carries prognostic relevance. Objective: To examine the association between objectively measured sedentary behavior (its total volume and accrual in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts) and all-cause mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Contiguous United States. Participants: 7985 black and white adults aged 45 years or older. Measurements: Sedentary time was measured using a hipmounted accelerometer. Prolonged, uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated comparing quartiles 2 through 4 to quartile 1 for each exposure (quartile cut points: 689.7, 746.5, and 799.4 min/d for total sedentary time; 7.7, 9.6, and 12.4 min/ bout for sedentary bout duration) in models that included moderate to vigorous physical activity. Results: Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 340 participants died. In multivariable-adjusted models, greater total sedentary time (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.74 to 2.02]; HR, 1.61 [CI, 0.99 to 2.63]; and HR, 2.63 [CI, 1.60 to 4.30]; P for trend < 0.001) and longer sedentary bout duration (HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.67 to 1.60]; HR, 1.22 [CI, 0.80 to 1.85]; and HR, 1.96 [CI, 1.31 to 2.93]; P for trend < 0.001) were both associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality. Evaluation of their joint association showed that participants classified as high for both sedentary characteristics (high sedentary time [≥12.5 h/d] and high bout duration [≥10 min/bout]) had the greatest risk for death. Limitation: Participants may not be representative of the general U.S. population. Conclusion: Both the total volume of sedentary time and its accrual in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts are associated with all-cause mortality, suggesting that physical activity guidelines should target reducing and interrupting sedentary time to reduce risk for death.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of lightintensity walking (LW) or simple resistance activities (SRA) improves postprandial cardiometabolic risk markers in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a randomized crossover trial, 24 inactive overweight/obese adults with T2D (14 men 62 6 6 years old) underwent the following 8-h conditions on three separate days (with 6-14 days washout): uninterrupted sitting (control) (SIT), sitting plus 3-min bouts of LW (3.2 km. h21) every 30 min, and sitting plus 3-min bouts of SRA (half-squats, calf raises, gluteal contractions, and knee raises) every 30 min. Standardized meals were consumed during each condition. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUCs) for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and triglycerides were compared between conditions. RESULTS Compared with SIT, both activity-break conditions significantly attenuated iAUCs for glucose (SIT mean 24.2 mmol . h . L21 [95% CI 20.4-28.0] vs. LW 14.8 [11.0- 18.6] and SRA 14.7 [10.9-18.5]), insulin (SIT 3,293 pmol . h . L21 [2,887-3,700] vs. LW 2,104 [1,696-2,511] and SRA 2,066 [1,660-2,473]), and C-peptide (SIT 15,641 pmol . h . L21 [14,353-16,929] vs. LW 11,504 [10,209-12,799] and SRA 11,012 [9,723-12,301]) (all P < 0.001). The iAUC for triglycerides was significantly attenuated for SRA (P < 0.001) but not for LW(SIT 4.8mmol . h . L21 [3.6-6.0] vs. LW4.0 [2.8-5.1] and SRA 2.9 [1.7-4.1]). CONCLUSIONS Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of LW or SRA attenuates acute postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and triglyceride responses in adults with T2D. With poor adherence to structured exercise, this approach is potentially beneficial and practical.},

If we would be able to understand how the human brain perceives information and operate it, and how do we make our decisions, we could more precisely make the future forecasts and increase our efficiency. We obtain information from the external world from our senses: taste, hearing, smell, touch, sight. Than we somehow integrate and analyze perceived information and make our decision. Decision is an "outcome of mental processes (cognitive process) leading to the selection of a course of action among several alternatives. Every decision making process produces a final choice". How do we make a decision, or even better to ask what leads us to make a decision? All our decisions are directed by our instincts, unconsciously. The basic human instinct is self-preservation or, in other words, survival and reproduction. But the decisions, which we make according to our instincts, are different. In this study, we are going to learn what the role of perception on the consumer buying decision process is.},

   abstract = {Online behavioural advertising (OBA) is a special form of targeted advertising. For OBA, it is necessary to collect data about online surfing behaviour, which is usually undertaken by installing 'cookies'. The use of cookies is heavily debated by policy makers in the US and Europe. Central to this discussion is whether users should provide informed consent prior to the installation of cookies. However, to provide informed consent, it is vital that website users understand the mechanisms of OBA and cookies. This study investigates whether the existing knowledge is sufficient, whether website users are concerned about their privacy, and how they cope with OBA, cookies and the requested informed consent. An online questionnaire (N = 2022) was fielded briefly after new European cookie regulations were enacted. The results confirmed that the knowledge is still insufficient to obtain good understanding of this new advertising technique. In addition, the results showed that groups of Internet users did not differ in terms of knowledge, although they did differ in terms of privacy concerns. A comparison of privacy-concerned groups showed that a dual approach is needed in communicating about OBA, not only to inform but also to reduce worries, especially in older and less-educated groups. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The effect of internet advertising has been a controversial issue, especially on the topic of how to effectively draw more attention from internet users. According to traditional attention theory, we know people pay lesser attention on other objects if the main browsing contents occupy more of the viewer's mental resources. Therefore, we know different information types of webpage should have different influences on users' attention. On the other hand, an effect called 'banner blindness' makes viewers naturally overlook the advertising based on their previous experience. It is therefore becoming more and more difficult to increase viewer's attention on advertisement simply by adding salient features on the advertisements. In light of this new challenge in Internet advertising, verifying the different influences of the information types on advertising attention is the main goal of this study. Great amounts of previous studies relevant to internet advertising focused on the advertisement itself, like the form, color, size and location. However, this study put focus on how the information types and the webpage structure influence the viewer's attention on banner advertising. This research tested the effect on user attention of four common information types on Internet webpages: (1) text-based webpage; (2) text-picture mixed webpage; (3) picture-based webpage; and (4) video-based webpage. This study hopes to provide valuable information for matching advertising with viewing tasks that will stimulate the most user attention. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Chronic and mental health conditions are increasingly prevalent worldwide. As devices in our everyday lives offer more and more voice-based self-service, voice-based conversational agents (VCAs) have the potential to support the prevention and management of these conditions in a scalable manner. However, evidence on VCAs dedicated to the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions is unclear. Objective: This study provides a better understanding of the current methods used in the evaluation of health interventions for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions delivered through VCAs. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We included primary research involving the prevention or management of chronic or mental health conditions through a VCA and reporting an empirical evaluation of the system either in terms of system accuracy, technology acceptance, or both. A total of 2 independent reviewers conducted the screening and data extraction, and agreement between them was measured using Cohen kappa. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the selected records. Results: Of 7170 prescreened papers, 12 met the inclusion criteria. All studies were nonexperimental. The VCAs provided behavioral support (n=5), health monitoring services (n=3), or both (n=4). The interventions were delivered via smartphones (n=5), tablets (n=2), or smart speakers (n=3). In 2 cases, no device was specified. A total of 3 VCAs targeted cancer, whereas 2 VCAs targeted diabetes and heart failure. The other VCAs targeted hearing impairment, asthma, Parkinson disease, dementia, autism, intellectual disability, and depression. The majority of the studies (n=7) assessed technology acceptance, but only few studies (n=3) used validated instruments. Half of the studies (n=6) reported either performance measures on speech recognition or on the ability of VCAs to respond to health-related queries. Only a minority of the studies (n=2) reported behavioral measures or a measure of attitudes toward intervention-targeted health behavior. Moreover, only a minority of studies (n=4) reported controlling for participants' previous experience with technology. Finally, risk bias varied markedly. Conclusions: The heterogeneity in the methods, the limited number of studies identified, and the high risk of bias show that research on VCAs for chronic and mental health conditions is still in its infancy. Although the results of system accuracy and technology acceptance are encouraging, there is still a need to establish more conclusive evidence on the efficacy of VCAs for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions, both in absolute terms and in comparison with standard health care.},

   abstract = {In today's advancing ubiquitous computing age, with its ever-increasing amount of information from various applications and services available for consumption, the management of people's attention has become very important. In particular, the high volume of notifications on mobile devices has become a major cause of interruption of users. There has been much research aimed at detecting the opportune moment to present such information to users with in a way that lowers the cognitive load or frustration. However, evaluation of such systems in the real-world production environment with real users and notifications, and evaluation on user's engagement to the presented notification beyond simple responsiveness have not been adequately studied. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate user interruptibility and engagement using a real-world large-scale mobile application and real-world notifications consisting of actual news content. We equipped the Yahoo! JAPAN Android app, one of the most popular applications on the national market, with our mobile-sensing and machine-learning-based interruptibility estimation logic. We conducted a large-scale in-the-wild user study with more than 680,000 users for three weeks. The results show that in most cases delaying the notification delivery until an interruptible moment is detected is beneficial to users and results in significant reduction of user response time (49.7%) compared to delivering the notifications immediately. We also observed a higher number of notifications opened in our system as well as constant improvement in user engagement levels throughout the entire study period.},

   abstract = {Background: Self-monitoring for weight loss has traditionally been performed with paper diaries. Technologic advances could reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide feedback to enhance adherence. Purpose: To determine if self-monitoring diet using a PDA only or the PDA with daily tailored feedback (PDA+feedback [FB]), was superior to using a paper diary on weight loss and maintenance. Design: The Self-Monitoring and Recording Using Technology (SMART) Trial was a 24-month randomized clinical trial; participants were randomly assigned to one of three self-monitoring groups. Setting/participants: From 2006 to 2008, a total of 210 overweight/obese adults (84.8% female, 78.1% white) were recruited from the community. Data were analyzed in 2011. Intervention: Participants received standard behavioral treatment for weight loss that included dietary and physical activity goals, encouraged the use of self-monitoring, and was delivered in group sessions. Main outcome measures: Percentage weight change at 24 months, adherence to self-monitoring over time. Results: Study retention was 85.6%. The mean percentage weight loss at 24 months was not different among groups (paper diary: -1.94%, 95% CI = -3.88, 0.01; PDA: -1.38%, 95% CI= -3.38, 0.62; PDA+FB: -2.32%, 95% CI= -4.29, -0.35); only the PDA+FB group (p=0.02) demonstrated a significant loss. For adherence to self-monitoring, there was a time-by-treatment group interaction between the combined PDA groups and the paper diary group (p=0.03) but no difference between PDA and PDA+FB groups (p=0.49). Across all groups, weight loss was greater for those who were adherent <60% versus <30% of the time (p<0.001). Conclusions: PDA+FB use resulted in a small weight loss at 24 months; PDA use resulted in greater adherence to dietary self-monitoring over time. However, for sustained weight loss, adherence to self-monitoring is more important than the method used to self-monitor. A daily feedback message delivered remotely enhanced adherence and improved weight loss, which suggests that technology can play a role in improving weight loss.

abstract = {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a na\"{\i}ve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6\% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

abstract = {Wearable sensors are increasingly becoming the primary interface for monitoring human activities. However, in order to scale human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors to million of users and devices, it is imperative that HAR computational models are robust against real-world heterogeneity in inertial sensor data. In this paper, we study the problem of wearing diversity which pertains to the placement of the wearable sensor on the human body, and demonstrate that even state-of-the-art deep learning models are not robust against these factors. The core contribution of the paper lies in presenting a first-of-its-kind in-depth study of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms in the context of wearing diversity -- we develop and evaluate three adaptation techniques on four HAR datasets to evaluate their relative performance towards addressing the issue of wearing diversity. More importantly, we also do a careful analysis to learn the downsides of each UDA algorithm and uncover several implicit data-related assumptions without which these algorithms suffer a major degradation in accuracy. Taken together, our experimental findings caution against using UDA as a silver bullet for adapting HAR models to new domains, and serve as practical guidelines for HAR practitioners as well as pave the way for future research on domain adaptation in HAR.},

Prior work has trained models using data from single longitudinal studies, collected from demographically homogeneous populations, over short time periods, using a single data collection platform or mobile application. The generalizability of model performance across studies has not been assessed. This study presents a first analysis to understand if models trained using combined longitudinal study data to predict mental health symptoms generalize across current publicly available data. We combined data from the CrossCheck (individuals living with schizophrenia) and StudentLife (university students) studies. In addition to assessing generalizability, we explored if personalizing models to align mobile sensing data, and oversampling less-represented severe symptoms, improved model performance. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) results were reported. Two symptoms (sleep quality and stress) had similar question-response structures across studies and were used as outcomes to explore cross-dataset prediction. Models trained with combined data were more likely to be predictive (significant improvement over predicting training data mean) than models trained with single-study data. Expected model performance improved if the distance between training and validation feature distributions decreased using combined versus single-study data. Personalization aligned each LOSO-CV participant with training data, but only improved predicting CrossCheck stress. Oversampling significantly improved severe symptom classification sensitivity and positive predictive value, but decreased model specificity. Taken together, these results show that machine learning models trained on combined longitudinal study data may generalize across heterogeneous datasets. We encourage researchers to disseminate collected de-identified mobile sensing and mental health symptom data, and further standardize data types collected across studies to enable better assessment of model generalizability.},

    abstract = {Background: As mobile health (mHealth) studies become increasingly productive owing to the advancements in wearable and mobile sensor technology, our ability to monitor and model human behavior will be constrained by participant receptivity. Many health constructs are dependent on subjective responses, and without such responses, researchers are left with little to no ground truth to accompany our ever-growing biobehavioral data. This issue can significantly impact the quality of a study, particularly for populations known to exhibit lower compliance rates. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed innovative approaches that use machine learning (ML) and sensor data to modify the timing and delivery of surveys. However, an overarching concern is the potential introduction of biases or unintended influences on participants’ responses when implementing new survey delivery methods.
Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the potential impact of an ML-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) delivery system (using receptivity as the predictor variable) on the participants’ reported emotional state. We examine the factors that affect participants’ receptivity to EMAs in a 10-day wearable and EMA–based emotional state–sensing mHealth study. We study the physiological relationships indicative of receptivity and affect while also analyzing the interaction between the 2 constructs.
Methods: We collected data from 45 healthy participants wearing 2 devices measuring electrodermal activity, accelerometer, electrocardiography, and skin temperature while answering 10 EMAs daily, containing questions about perceived mood. Owing to the nature of our constructs, we can only obtain ground truth measures for both affect and receptivity during responses. Therefore, we used unsupervised and supervised ML methods to infer affect when a participant did not respond. Our unsupervised method used k-means clustering to determine the relationship between physiology and receptivity and then inferred the emotional state during nonresponses. For the supervised learning method, we primarily used random forest and neural networks to predict the affect of unlabeled data points as well as receptivity.
Results: Our findings showed that using a receptivity model to trigger EMAs decreased the reported negative affect by {\textgreater}3 points or 0.29 SDs in our self-reported affect measure, scored between 13 and 91. The findings also showed a bimodal distribution of our predicted affect during nonresponses. This indicates that this system initiates EMAs more commonly during states of higher positive emotions.
Conclusions: Our results showed a clear relationship between affect and receptivity. This relationship can affect the efficacy of an mHealth study, particularly those that use an ML algorithm to trigger EMAs. Therefore, we propose that future work should focus on a smart trigger that promotes EMA receptivity without influencing affect during sampled time points.},

    abstract = {Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions.
            We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40\% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.},

    abstract = {Mental health disorders affect a substantial portion of the global population. Despite preferences for psychotherapy, access remains limited due to various barriers. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have emerged to increase accessibility, yet engagement and treatment completion rates are concerning. Evidence across healthcare where some degree of self-management is required show that treatment engagement is negatively influenced by contextual complexity. This article examines the non-random factors influencing patient engagement in digital and face-to-face psychological therapies. It reviews established models and introduces an adapted version of the Cumulative Complexity Model (CuCoM) as a framework for understanding engagement in the context of digital mental health. Theoretical models like the Fogg Behavior Model, Persuasive System Design, Self-Determination Theory, and Supportive Accountability aim to explain disengagement. However, none adequately consider these broader contextual factors and their complex interactions with personal characteristics, intervention requirements and technology features. We expand on these models by proposing an application of CuCoM’s application in mental health and digital contexts (known as DiCuCoM), focusing on the interplay between patient burden, personal capacity, and treatment demands. Standardized DMHIs often fail to consider individual variations in burden and capacity, leading to engagement variation. DiCuCoM highlights the need for balancing patient workload with capacity to improve engagement. Factors such as life demands, burden of treatment, and personal capacity are examined for their influence on treatment adherence. The article proposes a person-centered approach to treatment, informed by models like CuCoM and Minimally Disruptive Medicine, emphasizing the need for mental healthcare systems to acknowledge and address the unique burdens and capacities of individuals. Strategies for enhancing engagement include assessing personal capacity, reducing treatment burden, and utilizing technology to predict and respond to disengagement. New interventions informed by such models could lead to better engagement and ultimately better outcomes.},

    abstract = {Collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life has been widely employed for the monitoring of mental health. Variations in parameters such as movement, sleep duration, heart rate, electrocardiogram, skin temperature, etc., are often associated with psychiatric disorders. Namely, accelerometer data, microphone, and call logs can be utilized to identify voice features and social activities indicative of depressive symptoms, and physiological factors such as heart rate and skin conductance can be used to detect stress and anxiety disorders. Therefore, a wide range of devices comprising a variety of sensors have been developed to capture these physiological and behavioral data and translate them into phenotypes and states related to mental health. Such systems aim to identify behaviors that are the consequence of an underlying physiological alteration, and hence, the raw sensor data are captured and converted into features that are used to deﬁne behavioral markers, often through machine learning. However, due to the complexity of passive data, these relationships are not simple and need to be well-established. Furthermore, parameters such as intrapersonal and interpersonal differences need to be considered when interpreting the data. Altogether, combining practical mobile and wearable systems with the right data analysis algorithms can provide a useful tool for the monitoring and management of mental disorders. The current review aims to comprehensively present and critically discuss all available smartphone-based, wearable, and environmental sensors for detecting such parameters in relation to the treatment and/or management of the most common mental health conditions.},

    abstract = {Background: Sensors and digital devices have revolutionized the measurement, collection, and storage of behavioral and physiological data, leading to the new term digital biomarkers.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the scope of clinical evidence covered by systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials involving digital biomarkers.
Methods: This scoping review was organized using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. With the search limited to English publications, full-text SRs of digital biomarkers included randomized controlled trials that involved a human population and reported changes in participants’ health status. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched with time frames limited to 2019 and 2020. The World Health Organization’s classification systems for diseases (International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision), health interventions (International Classification of Health Interventions), and bodily functions (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health [ICF]) were used to classify populations, interventions, and outcomes, respectively.
Results: A total of 31 SRs met the inclusion criteria. The majority of SRs studied patients with circulatory system diseases (19/31, 61\%) and respiratory system diseases (9/31, 29\%). Most of the prevalent interventions focused on physical activity behavior (16/31, 52\%) and conversion of cardiac rhythm (4/31, 13\%). Looking after one’s health (physical activity; 15/31, 48\%), walking (12/31, 39\%), heart rhythm functions (8/31, 26\%), and mortality (7/31, 23\%) were the most commonly reported outcomes. In total, 16 physiological and behavioral data groups were identified using the ICF tool, such as looking after one’s health (physical activity; 14/31, 45\%), walking (11/31, 36\%), heart rhythm (7/31, 23\%), and weight maintenance functions (7/31, 23\%). Various digital devices were also studied to collect these data in the included reviews, such as smart glasses, smartwatches, smart bracelets, smart shoes, and smart socks for measuring heart functions, gait pattern functions, and temperature. A substantial number (24/31, 77\%) of digital biomarkers were used as interventions. Moreover, wearables (22/31, 71\%) were the most common types of digital devices. Position sensors (21/31, 68\%) and heart rate sensors and pulse rate sensors (12/31, 39\%) were the most prevalent types of sensors used to acquire behavioral and physiological data in the SRs.
Conclusions: In recent years, the clinical evidence concerning digital biomarkers has been systematically reviewed in a wide range of study populations, interventions, digital devices, and sensor technologies, with the dominance of physical activity and cardiac monitors. We used the World Health Organization’s ICF tool for classifying behavioral and physiological data, which seemed to be an applicable tool to categorize the broad scope of digital biomarkers identified in this review. To understand the clinical value of digital biomarkers, the strength and quality of the evidence on their health consequences need to be systematically evaluated.},

    abstract = {The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune moments, adapting to users’ evolving contexts and needs. Although prior research has examined how context affects user responses to generic notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions. Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to understanding receptivity — users’ willingness and ability to engage with and act upon the intervention. In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components: acceptance (acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions. The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility, and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity to interventions. We found that the evening was the most feasible time to deliver interventions for higher acceptance. Participants were also more willing to perform suggested tasks when walking or eating. Our findings contribute insights into the design of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also actionable in real-world settings.},

We investigated the contextual factors that influence young adults’ day-to-day experiences when interacting with such tools. Through interviews and focus group discussions with 36 participants, we identified that people’s daily schedules and affective states were dominant factors that shape their messaging preferences. We developed two messaging dialogues centered around these factors, which we deployed to 42 participants to test and extend our initial understanding of users’ needs. Across both studies, participants provided diverse opinions of how they could be best supported by messages, particularly around when to engage users in more passive versus active ways. They also proposed ways of adjusting message length and content during periods of low mood. Our findings provide design implications and opportunities for context-aware mental health management systems.},

In a real-world study we collect around 70,000 instances of notiﬁcations from 35 users. We group notiﬁcations according to the applications that initiated them, and the social relationship between the sender and the receiver. Then, by considering both content and context information, such as the current activity of a user, we discuss the design of classiﬁers for learning the most opportune moment for the delivery of a notiﬁcation carrying a speciﬁc type of information. Our results show that such classiﬁers lead to a more accurate prediction of users’ interruptibility than an alternative approach based on user-deﬁned rules of their own interruptibility.},

As more mobile applications push notifications to users, they constantly face decisions on what to send, when and how. A lack of research and methodology commonly leads to heuristic decision making. Many notifications arrive at an inappropriate moment or introduce too many interruptions, failing to provide value to users and spurring users’ complaints. In this paper we explore unique features of interactions between mobile notifications and user engagement. We propose a state transition framework to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of notifications. Within this framework, we develop a survival model for badging notifications assuming a log-linear structure and a Weibull distribution. Our results show that this model achieves more flexibility for applications and superior prediction accuracy than a logistic regression model. In particular, we provide an online use case on notification delivery time optimization to show how we make better decisions, drive more user engagement, and provide more value to users.},

            For the past two decades the Cox proportional hazards model has been used extensively to examine the covariate effects on the hazard function for the failure time variable. On the other hand, the accelerated failure time model, which simply regresses the logarithm of the survival time over the covariates, has seldom been utilized in the analysis of censored survival data. In this article, we review some newly developed linear regression methods for analysing failure time observations. These procedures have sound theoretical justification and can be implemented with an efficient numerical method. The accelerated failure time model has an intuitive physical interpretation and would be a useful alternative to the Cox model in survival analysis.},

However, some basic yet important questions have not been suﬃciently addressed, e.g., what distribution is appropriate to model the distribution of dwell times on a Web page, and furthermore, what the distribution tells us about the underlying browsing behaviors. In this paper, we draw an analogy between abandoning a page during Web browsing and a system failure in reliability analysis, and propose to model the dwell time using the Weibull distribution. Using this distribution provides better goodness-of-ﬁt to real world data, and it uncovers some interesting patterns of user browsing behaviors not previously reported. For example, our analysis reveals that Web browsing in general exhibits a signiﬁcant “negative aging” phenomenon, which means that some initial screening has to be passed before a page is examined in detail, giving rise to the browsing behavior that we call “screen-and-glean.” In addition, we demonstrate that dwell time distributions can be reasonably predicted purely based on low-level page features, which broadens the possible applications of this study to situations where log data may be unavailable.},

While a wide range of models for social behavior dynamics have been proposed in recent years, the essential ingredients and the minimum model for social behavior dynamics is still largely unanswered. Here, we ﬁnd that human interaction behavior dynamics exhibit rich complexities over the response time dimension and natural time dimension by exploring a large scale social communication dataset. To tackle this challenge, we develop a temporal Heterogeneous Survival framework where the regularities in response time dimension and natural time dimension can be organically integrated. We apply our model in two online social communication datasets. Our model can successfully regenerate the interaction patterns in the social communication datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can signiﬁcantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines. Meanwhile, the learnt parameters and discovered statistical regularities can lead to multiple potential applications.},

Here we apply survival theory to develop general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference problems can be solved eﬃciently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data.},

    abstract = {The study of career development has become more important during a time of rising competition. Even with the help of newly available big data in the ﬁeld of human resources, it is challenging to prospect the career development of talents in an eﬀective manner, since the nature and structure of talent careers can change quickly. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel survival analysis approach to model the talent career paths, with a focus on two critical issues in talent management, namely turnover and career progression. Speciﬁcally, for modeling the talent turnover behaviors, we formulate the prediction of survival status at a sequence of time intervals as a multi-task learning problem by considering the prediction at each time interval as a task. Also, we impose the ranking constraints to model both censored and uncensored data, and capture the intrinsic properties exhibited in general lifetime modeling with non-recurrent and recurrent events. Similarly, for modeling the talent career progression, each task concerns the prediction of a relative occupational level at each time interval. The ranking constraints imposed on diﬀerent occupational levels can help to reduce the prediction error. Finally, we evaluate our approach with several state-of-the-art baseline methods on realworld talent data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed models for predicting the turnover and career progression of talents.},

    abstract = {Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and ﬁnance, engineering, medicine and many other areas. A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times (times-to-event). Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the ﬁrst hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a speciﬁc form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of ﬁrst hitting times (the risk). However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated. This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly. DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time. Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest. Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically signiﬁcant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

    abstract = {Currently available risk prediction methods are limited in their ability to deal with complex, heterogeneous, and longitudinal data such as that available in primary care records, or in their ability to deal with multiple competing risks. This paper develops a novel deep learning approach that is able to successfully address current limitations of standard statistical approaches such as landmarking and joint modeling. Our approach, which we call Dynamic-DeepHit, ﬂexibly incorporates the available longitudinal data comprising various repeated measurements (rather than only the last available measurements) in order to issue dynamically updated survival predictions for one or multiple competing risk(s). Dynamic-DeepHit learns the time-to-event distributions without the need to make any assumptions about the underlying stochastic models for the longitudinal and the time-to-event processes. Thus, unlike existing works in statistics, our method is able to learn data-driven associations between the longitudinal data and the various associated risks without underlying model speciﬁcations. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to a real-world longitudinal dataset from the U.K. Cystic Fibrosis Registry, which includes a heterogeneous cohort of 5883 adult patients with annual follow-ups between 2009 to 2015. The results show that Dynamic-DeepHit provides a drastic improvement in discriminating individual risks of different forms of failures due to cystic ﬁbrosis. Furthermore, our analysis utilizes post-processing statistics that provide clinical insight by measuring the inﬂuence of each covariate on risk predictions and the temporal importance of longitudinal measurements, thereby enabling us to identify covariates that are inﬂuential for different competing risks.},

    abstract = {Survival analysis is a crucial statistical technique used to estimate the anticipated duration until a specific event occurs. However, current methods often involve discretizing the time scale and struggle with managing absent features within the data. This becomes especially pertinent since events can transpire at any given point, rendering event analysis a continuous concern. Additionally, the presence of missing attributes within tabular data is widespread. By leveraging recent developments of Transformer and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), we introduce SSL-SurvFormer. This entails a continuously monotonic Transformer network, empowered by SSL pre-training, that is designed to address the challenges presented by continuous events and absent features in survival prediction. Our proposed continuously monotonic Transformer model facilitates accurate estimation of survival probabilities, thereby bypassing the need for temporal discretization. Additionally, our SSL pre-training strategy incorporates data transformation to adeptly manage missing information. The SSL pre-training encompasses two tasks: mask prediction, which identifies positions of absent features, and reconstruction, which endeavors to recover absent elements based on observed ones. Our empirical evaluations conducted across a variety of datasets, including FLCHAIN, METABRIC, and SUPPORT, consistently highlight the superior performance of SSL-SurvFormer in comparison to existing methods. Additionally, SSL-SurvFormer demonstrates effectiveness in handling missing values, a critical aspect often encountered in real-world datasets.},

Circa 2.76 million breathing sounds from 43 subjects and control sounds were collected and labeled to train and test our breathing detection algorithm. We model breathing as inhalation-pause-exhalation-pause sequences and implement a phase-detection system with an attention-based LSTM model in conjunction with a CNN-based breath extraction module. A biofeedback-guided breathing training with Breeze takes place in real-time and achieves 75.5\% accuracy in breathing phases detection. Breeze was also evaluated in a pilot study with 16 new subjects, which demonstrated that the majority of subjects prefer Breeze over a validated active control condition in its usefulness, enjoyment, control, and usage intentions. Breeze is also effective for strengthening users' cardiac functioning by increasing high-frequency heart rate variability. The results of our study suggest that Breeze could potentially be utilized in clinical and self-care activities.},

It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k = 9), Hedges’s g = 1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k = 21), g = 0.89. Also, participants of JITAI interventions showed significant changes (k = 13) in the positive direction (g = 0.79). A series of sensitivity tests suggested that those effects persist. Those effects also persist despite differences in the behaviors of interests (e.g., blood glucose control, recovering alcoholics), duration of the treatments, and participants’ age. Two aspects of tailoring, namely: (1) tailoring to what (i.e., both people’s previous behavioral patterns and their current need states; with these effects additive) and (2) approach to tailoring (i.e., both using a human agent and an algorithm to decide tailored feedback; with these effects additive), are significantly associated with greater JITAI efficacy.},

    abstract = {Background
              Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are interventions designed to deliver timely tailored support by adjusting to changes in users' internal states and external contexts. To accomplish this, JITAIs often apply complex analytic techniques, such as machine learning or Bayesian algorithms to real- or near-time data acquired from smartphones and other sensors. Given the idiosyncratic, dynamic, and context dependent nature of mental health symptoms, JITAIs hold promise for mental health. However, the development of JITAIs is still in the early stages and is complex due to the multifactorial nature of JITAIs. Considering this complexity, Nahum-Shani et al. developed a conceptual framework for developing and testing JITAIs for health-related problems. This review evaluates the current state of JITAIs in the field of mental health including their alignment with Nahum-Shani et al.'s framework.
              Methods
              Nine databases were systematically searched in August 2023. Protocol or empirical studies self-identifying their intervention as a “JITAI” targeting mental health were included in the qualitative synthesis if they were published in peer-reviewed journals and written in English.
              Results
              Of the 1,419 records initially screened, 9 papers reporting on 5 JITAIs were included (sample size range: 5 to an expected 264). Two JITAIs were for bulimia nervosa, one for depression, one for insomnia, and one for maternal prenatal stress. Although most core components of Nahum-Shani's et al.'s framework were incorporated in the JITAIs, essential elements (e.g., adaptivity and receptivity) within the core components were missing and the core components were only partly substantiated by empirical evidence (e.g., interventions were supported, but the decision rules and points were not). Complex analytical techniques such as data from passive monitoring of individuals' states and contexts were hardly used. Regarding the current state of studies, initial findings on usability, feasibility, and effectiveness appear positive.
              Conclusions
              JITAIs for mental health are still in their early stages of development, with opportunities for improvement in both development and testing. For future development, it is recommended that developers utilize complex analytical techniques that can handle real-or near-time data such as machine learning, passive monitoring, and conduct further research into empirical-based decision rules and points for optimization in terms of enhanced effectiveness and user-engagement.},

    abstract = {Time series forecasting is critical for various fields such as stock market prediction, weather forecasting, and risk management. Traditional models like ARIMA and SARIMA are limited in capturing non-linear and multivariate dependencies in time series data. Deep learning models such as LSTM and Transformer-based architectures have emerged to address these issues but come with challenges like overfitting and high computational complexity. This paper introduces PatchFusionBERT, a novel hybrid model that integrates BERT layers with PatchTST to overcome these limitations. PatchTST partitions long time series into smaller patches to capture local temporal patterns, while BERT layers enhance long-term dependency capture. Experimental results on the ETT dataset show that PatchFusionBERT significantly outperforms PatchTST in both short- and longterm horizons, especially in multivariate time series forecasting. PatchFusionBERT demonstrates improved forecasting accuracy while also being computationally efficient.},

    abstract = {When using point-by-point data input with former series models for wind power prediction, the prediction accuracy decreases due to data distribution shifts and the inability to extract local information. To address these issues, this paper proposes an ultra-short-term wind power prediction model based on the Z-score (ZS), Dish-TS (DT), and Patch time series Transformer (PatchTST). Firstly, to reduce the impact of data distribution shift on prediction accuracy, ZS standardization is applied to both training and testing datasets. Additionally, the DT algorithm, which can self-learn the mean and variance, is introduced for window data standardization. Secondly, the PatchTST model is employed to convert point input data into local-level input data. Feature extraction is then performed using the multi-head attention mechanism in the Encoder layer and a feed-forward network composed of one-dimensional convolution to obtain the prediction results. These results are subsequently destandardized using DT and ZS to restore the original data amplitude. Finally, experimental analysis is conducted, comparing the proposed ZS-DT-PatchTST model with various prediction models. The proposed model achieves the highest prediction accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.95 MW, a mean squared error of 10.89 MW, and a coefﬁcient of determination of 97.38\%.},

    abstract = {We propose an efﬁcient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold beneﬁt: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy signiﬁcantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pretraining tasks and attain excellent ﬁne-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

    volume = {8},
    abstract = {Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for inferences regarding health and well-being, behavior, and context. However, a significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in real-world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the distribution of data in the real world—the deployment environment. Even though explored extensively in computer vision and natural language processing, and while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such as audio or accelerometer readings. Consequently, there exists a lack of research on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) showing that they effectively handle distribution shifts in multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN, called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12\% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression tasks.

Their heterogeneous and complex forms have brought certain difficulties to analyzing longitudinal data in survival studies. Deep learning and machine learning can capture the nonlinear relationships between covariates and clinical events without relying on strict assumptions. The objective of this paper is to transfer the Transformer framework in deep learning to survival analysis and propose the Transformer-Dynamic survival model, to discover the complex relationship between the longitudinal covariates and survival time. This model leverages the multi-head attention mechanism of the Transformer to effectively learn the dynamic trajectories of repeated measurements. It captures the information in longitudinal measurements, thereby enhancing survival prediction accuracy. The model can dynamically update the prediction risks when new observed covariates are available. Compared to state-of-the-art models, the Transformer-Dynamic model demonstrates superior predictive and generalization abilities on the Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Data (PBC2) dataset. Furthermore, we use SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) values to interpret the impact of features on the model’s predictions. By analyzing key features and proposing personalized monitoring for individuals, this study highlights the model’s excellent predictive accuracy as well as its interpretability, providing effective decision support for clinicians.},

However, current methods typically involve cluttered probability distribution function (PDF), have lower sensitivity in censoring prediction, only model static datasets, or only rely on recurrent neural networks for dynamic modelling. In this paper, we propose a novel survival regression method capable of producing high-quality unimodal PDFs without any prior distribution assumption, by optimizing novel Margin-Mean-Variance loss and leveraging the flexibility of Transformer to handle both temporal and non-temporal data, coined UniSurv. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that UniSurv places a significantly higher emphasis on censoring compared to other methods.},

    abstract = {When transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task, two popular methods are full ﬁne-tuning (updating all the model parameters) and linear probing (updating only the last linear layer—the “head”). It is well known that ﬁne-tuning leads to better accuracy in-distribution (ID). However, in this paper, we ﬁnd that ﬁne-tuning can achieve worse accuracy than linear probing out-of-distribution (OOD) when the pretrained features are good and the distribution shift is large. On 10 distribution shift datasets (Breeds-Living17, Breeds-Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR → STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW, ImageNetV2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-Sketch), ﬁne-tuning obtains on average 2\% higher accuracy ID but 7\% lower accuracy OOD than linear probing. We show theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even in a simple setting: ﬁne-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks. We prove that the OOD error of ﬁne-tuning is high when we initialize with a ﬁxed or random head—this is because while ﬁne-tuning learns the head, the lower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the pretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of linear probing then full ﬁne-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a ﬁne-tuning heuristic, combines the beneﬁts of both ﬁne-tuning and linear probing. Empirically, LP-FT outperforms both ﬁne-tuning and linear probing on the above datasets (1\% better ID, 10\% better OOD than full ﬁne-tuning).},

We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization. Our analysis uncovers federated feature distortion, a phenomenon where local fine-tuning destabilizes globally learned features, and theoretically characterizes how LP-FT mitigates this via phased parameter updates. We further establish conditions (e.g., partial feature overlap, covariate-concept shift) under which LP-FT outperforms standard fine-tuning, offering actionable guidelines for deploying robust personalization in FL.},

    abstract = {Recently, secure and reliable identity recognition in mobile phones has become critical due to the rising cyber threats. Traditional identity recognition methods, such as passwords, are prone to brute-force attacks and phishing, while the existing biometric recognition, such as face recognition, voice recognition, and ﬁngerprint recognition, could be confronted with the issues of leakage and variability of the identity features, making them easy to replicate or degrade over time due to varying ages and environmental factors. To this end, we propose the wristrolling motion recognition (WRMR) method. WRMR leverages the unique motion patterns that require the sensors embedded in mobile phones. These motion patterns rely on the complex muscle memory and coordination, which makes the motion patterns highly individual and difﬁcult to imitate, reducing the risk of the identity features leakage. Moreover, the wrist-rolling motion patterns are less affected by the ages and emotional states of users, ensuring the long-term consistency and reliability. In WRMR, we specially introduce a Transformer-based model, termed patch time series transformer with the temporal-spatio attention (PatchTST-TSA), which accurately classiﬁes the time series data generated by the wrist-rolling motion. PatchTSTTSA enhances the original Transformer model structure by incorporating the patch embedding and temporal-spatio attention (TSA), thus effectively capturing the local dependencies and extracting the temporal-spatio features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PatchTST-TSA signiﬁcantly improves the classiﬁcation performance and noise resilience. WRMR presents a robust and accurate solution for the mobile phone unlocking, and highlights the potential of the time series classiﬁcation in the identity recognition.},

First, to the best of our knowledge, existing deep survival models use either fully connected or recurrent networks, and we are the ﬁrst to apply the Transformer in survival analysis. In addition, we use ordinal regression to optimize the survival probabilities over time, and penalize randomized discordant pairs. Second, many survival models are evaluated using only the ranking metrics such as the concordance index. We propose to also use the absolute error metric that evaluates the precise duration predictions on observed subjects. We demonstrate our model on two publicly available real-world datasets, and show that our mean absolute error results are signiﬁcantly better than the current models, meanwhile, it is challenging to determine the best model under the concordance index.},
